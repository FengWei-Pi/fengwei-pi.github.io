# The Future

- **Python**. Python is the language standard for machine learning and artificial intelligence, both for research and production. I'm interested in learning the language and its rich development ecosystem.

- **Generative Networks**. Generative adversarial networks were the starting point for AI art, and developing is the best way to learn how they work.
