# The Future

- **Python**. Python is the language standard for machine learning and artificial intelligence, both for research and production. I'm interested in learning the language and its rich development ecosystem.

- **Generative Networks**. Generative adversarial networks were the starting point for photo-realistic AI art, and developing is the best way to learn how they work.

- **Next.js**. Next.js is a feature-rich UI framework that's using React and growing fast. It has excellent tutorials and is an great opportunity to learn server-side rendering and more web concepts from an opinionated tool.
