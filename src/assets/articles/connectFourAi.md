# Connect Four AI

Inspired by [AlphaGo Zero](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-starting-from-scratch), I wanted to implement the same techniques but scaled down to work on a personal computer. I chose Connect Four as a much simpler turn-based game of perfect information and, after a few weeks of development, trained an AI agent that started from random moves to play Connect Four at a human level.
