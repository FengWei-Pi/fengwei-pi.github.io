# Plasmatic Technologies

Initially hiring for a backend position, Plasmatic Technologies brought me on as a QA Analyst where I transitioned to frontend app development. 

I started by writing unit tests for the consumer app and admin website. Bugfixing and refactoring legacy code was added to my responsibilities, as well as other feasible frontend tasks on the Jira board. The company was brushing up against AI, but I wanted to be more involved in machine learning, so I decided to leave to pursue other opportunities.
