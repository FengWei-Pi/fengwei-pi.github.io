Why values? I used to think expressing the usual values was pointless, since shouldn't everyone appreciate things like kindness, communication, and the pursuit of excellence? Now, I can think of several reasons to write my values down, one of which I found while surveying other personal websites. Most listed their background, work, and achievements, but scarcely anything about them as individuals. It felt strangely detached, as if suggesting that another person with identical achievements could replace them and nothing would change. Hopefully, the values below reveal more about me than my work ever could.

## Respect

Respect for others is the baseline for fruitful endeavours and the bare minimum required for cooperation. Skill is appreciated, but respect is distinguished first[^1], its importance evidenced by the salient, engrossing feeling when shown a stark lack of respect.

It's a necessity I needed to highlight because it's one easy to overlook and especially easy to lose when treated with anything else. After all, we have a wealth more information to judge ourselves that we instinctually miss the situational factors affecting the behaviour and attitude of other people[^2]. I want to give proper consideration for mistakes and celebration for successes, not for the sake of being nice, but for the aim of, by default, treating people as reasonable human beings.

## Cooperation 

It is not an understatement to say that cooperation is the backbone of human progress. We became the most advanced species because, among other reasons, we effortlessly form social connections[^3] and copy actions from each other[^4]. We progress by copying and improving upon the most successful.

For these reasons, I loved talking to workmates about the intricacies of technical problems, the benefits and downsides of possible solutions, and the resolution of shared decisions. They were a way to explore more arguments than I would have by myself, with disagreements especially a way to share points we believed were meaningful. At a minimum, we can copy other people's work with a mind for improvement later. At more, we can use one of the best tools at our disposal and work alongside each other to produce results better than our sum.

## Effort And Improvement

Success is a universal goal. Individually, the determining factor is often focused on a person's skill, but emphasizing ability neglects how it might change over time.

I emphasize effort because individuals perform better when they perceive ability as a malleable, improvable trait[^5]. When viewed otherwise, people become discouraged after a string of failures[^6]. To embrace challenges, criticism, and mistakes as a way to learn, I strive somewhat paradoxically less for the desired result and more for a substantial effort.
