# University of Waterloo

I went to the University of Waterloo to study computer science, and I found out the academic world was far more interested in theory than practical applications. I learned about objected oriented programming and data structures. Only in the third and fourth years did I discover my favourite courses, algorithms and AI, which kickstarted my fascination with machine learning and computers again.

I was enthralled by the techniques a computer program must have used to defeat an expert player of the board game Go, many years before the commonly held belief that computers could achieve the feat. In time, I researched and created my proudest work, a program using the same techniques to play the game Connect Four. But before then, I graduated and needed a job.
