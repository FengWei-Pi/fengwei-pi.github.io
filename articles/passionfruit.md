# Passionfruit

I was *Junior JavaScript Programmer* at Passionfruit, and I certainly felt junior when I started. The CEO took a chance on me and I was determined, as all enthusiastic first-job earners are, to do my best.

I familiarized myself with the practical side of web development, clients and servers, the git workflow, the node.js ecosystem, js frameworks, and more. Along with another junior developer and our company's small group of friends, we learned from each other, stumbled in the process, but always aimed for good practices and eventually published our app to mobile stores.

It was a short-term contract where I had great fun working with everyone and gained invaluable experience.
