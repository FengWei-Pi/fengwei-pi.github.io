# Background

Born in China, I immigrated to Canada along with my family in second grade. I planned to be a scientist in grade school, with no idea of what that meant, because I wanted things to make sense. I wanted logical explanations for the world I observed, to satisfy my curiosity about how things worked.

The biggest obstacle in my path was computers. I learned about the atomic model, the solar system, and how mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, but nothing about how computers displayed images to the screen or how websites, applications, and games were created. It was a fantastical black box with no one to help me peer inside it, so I decided my major objective was to uncover its inner workings.
