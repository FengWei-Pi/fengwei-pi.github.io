# Plasmatic Technologies

Initially hiring for a backend position, Plasmatic Technologies brought me on as a QA Analyst where I transitioned to frontend app development. 

I started by writing unit tests for the consumer app and admin website. Bugfixing was added to my responsibilities, as well as refactoring legacy code and implementing ui features. It was everything I was doing before, but I wanted to be challenged with something new so I left to pursue other opportunities.
