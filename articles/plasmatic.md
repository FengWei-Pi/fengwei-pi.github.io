# Plasmatic Technologies

Initially hiring for a backend position, Plasmatic Technologies brought me on as a QA Analyst where I transitioned to frontend app development. 

I wrote unit tests for the consumer app and admin website, bug-fixed frontend errors, refactored legacy code, and implemented UI features, coordinating between designers and quality control to nail newly developed features. It was the place where I learned the importance of processes and having a plan for when things don't go according to plan.
