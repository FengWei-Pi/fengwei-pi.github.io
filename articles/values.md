Why values? People may benefit from fortunate circumstances or suffer from unfortunate ones, but how we treat others and approach our work, that's always within our control.

## Respect

Respect for others is the baseline for fruitful endeavours and the bare minimum required for cooperation. Skill is appreciated, but respect is distinguished first[^1] by others.

It's a necessity easy to overlook and especially easy to lose when treated with anything else. People have a wealth more information to judge themselves that they instinctually miss the situational factors affecting the behaviour and attitude of other people[^2]. I want to give proper consideration to mistakes and celebration for successes for the aim of, by default, treating people as reasonable human beings.

## Cooperation 

Cooperation is the backbone of human progress. Humans became the most advanced species because, among other reasons, we effortlessly form social connections[^3] and copy actions from each other[^4]. We progress by studying and improving upon the most successful.

For these reasons, I loved talking to workmates about the intricacies of technical problems, the pros and cons of possible solutions, and the resolution of a shared decision. They were a way to explore more arguments than I would have by myself, with disagreements especially a way to share points we believed were meaningful. At a minimum, we can copy other people's work with a mind for improvement later. At more, we can use one of the best abilities at our disposal and work alongside each other to produce results better than our sum.

## Effort And Improvement

Success is a universal goal. Individually, a person's skill is highlighted as the determining factor, but emphasizing ability over improvement downplays long term success for short term results.

I emphasize effort because people perform better when they perceive ability as a malleable, improvable trait[^5], when they embrace challenges, criticism, and mistakes as a way to learn. When viewed otherwise, people become discouraged after a string of failures[^6]. Because of this, I strive somewhat paradoxically less for an exceptional result and more for a substantial effort.
